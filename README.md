# CannedPears
A WebView exploit using the pear assessment kiosk app to gain access to an unblocked browser (this is different than the forgot password one, that one was patched!)
DIRECTIONS:(WARNING:this is VERY tedious and a lot harder to do then forgot password!)

Step1: access the Pear Assesment app by pressing "apps" on your lock screen

Step2: press "sign in with Pear Learning"

Step3: Press "sign in with Microsoft"

Step4: Press "Sign in options" then "Github"

Step5: DO NOT press forgot password! instead, scroll to the bottom and press "Terms"

Step6: scroll to the bottom of this page, then press "Blog"

Step7: use the search bar on this page and search "google git" 

Step8: Scroll until you find the article "Google, Android, Git, and Github" and click on it

Step9: Click on the word "released". This should bring you to Android Source.

Step10: Scroll to the bottom of this page then click "google security blog"

Step11 (the last one!): now scroll to the bottom and click the google logo! you now have unblocked browser!

DISCLAIMER!!!: school internet filters still work! if you use this at school some websites will still be blocked! To go back use the physical back button on your keyboard. :)
